            <h3>Description of myself.</h3>
            I am Walter GARNIER, an indie creator that loves to learn a lot of things!<br/>
            I am passionate by multiple domains such as video games, of course, but also astronomy, prehistory, animals and much more!<br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>Why did I start creating?</h3>
            I started by playing video games very early and I really got into it quickly.<br/>
            I then always felt the envy of creating and playing games, but also making things I like and make the others like it!<br/>
            <br/>
            This is why I started creating things! I first of all started with some little pixel arts and the more I was going, the more I was experimenting, the more I got interested in a lot of other things!<br/>
            For example, I tried to play piano, made some musics, tried astronomy, learned history things, etc... And of course I started to create games at a certain time!<br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>A bit of my experience.</h3>
            As a lot of persons, it wasn't really good at first but I improved over time and the more I'm going, the more I'm improving!<br/>
            I started off to create and share the things I was doing back in 2015/2016, with YouTube videos, I then moved on and tried a lot of other things listed just before!<br/>
